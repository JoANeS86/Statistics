## Module 2: Probability

Standardization: The process of putting different variables on the same scale.

Z-score: A measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a data point is.

Z-score --> Z = (x-μ)/σ

## Module 3: Sampling

Statistic: A characteristic of a Sample.

Parameter: A characteristic of a Population.

Point Estimate: Uses a single value to estimate a population parameter.

Sampling Distribution: A probability distribution of a sample statistic.

Sampling Variability: How much an estimate varies between samples.

    The more variability in your sample data, the less likely it is
    that the sample mean is an accurate estimate of the population mean.

In statistics, the standard deviation of a sample statistic is called the standard error. The standard error of the mean measures variability among
all your sample means.

    Larger estandar error: Sample means are more spread out
    Smaller estandar error: Sample means are closer together

    The less standard error, the more likely it is that your
    sample mean is an accurate estimate of the population mean.

The Standard Error measures the differences between your sample mean and the actual population mean.

Standard error of the mean = S/√n

    S: The sample standard deviation
    n: The sample size

Central Limit Theorem: The sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases.

Population proportion: The percentage of individuals or elements in a population that share a certain characteristic.

The Standard Error of a proportion --> SE = √p(1−p)/n

## Module 4: Confidence Intervals

Confidence Interval: A range of values that describes the uncertainty surrounding an estimate.

Interval Estimate: In contrast to a Point Estimate, that uses a single value to estimate a population parameter, an Interval Estimate uses a range of
values to estimate a population parameter.

Interval --> Sample Statistic +/- Margin of Error

Margin of Error: The maximum expected difference between a population parameter and a sample estimate.

Margin of Error = Z-score * Standard Error

Confidence Level: Describes the likelihood that a particular sampling method will produce a confidence interval that includes the population
parameter.

Steps for constructing a confidence interval:

        1. Identify a sample statistic
        2. Choose a confidence level
        3. Find the margin of error
        4. Calculate the interval
