Statistic: A characteristic of a Sample.
Parameter: A characteristic of a Population.

Point estimate: Uses a single value to estimate a population parameter.

Sampling distribution: A probability distribution of a sample statistic.

Sampling variability: How much an estimate varies between samples.

    The more variability in your sample data, the less likely it is
    that the sample mean is an accurate estimate of the population mean.

In statistics, the standard deviation of a sample statistic is called the standard error. The standard error of the mean measures variability among all your sample means.

    Larger estandar error: Sample means are more spread out
    Smaller estandar error: Sample means are closer together

    The less standard error, the more likely it is that your
    sample mean is an accurate estimate of the population mean.

The Standard Error measures the differences between your sample mean and the actual population mean.

Standard error of the mean = S/âˆšn

    S: The sample standard deviation
    n: The sample size
